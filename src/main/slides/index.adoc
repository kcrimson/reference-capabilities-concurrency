[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
The major processor manufacturers and architectures, from Intel and AMD to Sparc and PowerPC, have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds and straight-line instruction throughput ever higher, they are instead turning en masse to hyperthreading and multicore architectures.

=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
Both of these features are already available on chips today; in particular, multicore is available on current PowerPC and Sparc IV processors, and is coming in 2005 from Intel and AMD. Indeed, the big theme of the 2004 In-Stat/MDR Fall Processor Forum was multicore devices, as many companies showed new or updated multicore processors. Looking back, it’s not much of a stretch to call 2004 the year of multicore.

=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
No matter how fast processors get, software consistently finds new ways to eat up the extra speed. Make a CPU ten times as fast, and software will usually find ten times as much to do (or, in some cases, will feel at liberty to do it ten times less efficiently). 


=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
Most classes of applications have enjoyed free and regular performance gains for several decades, even without releasing new versions or doing anything special, because the CPU manufacturers (primarily) and memory and disk manufacturers (secondarily) have reliably enabled ever-newer and ever-faster mainstream systems. 


=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
Clock speed isn’t the only measure of performance, or even necessarily a good one, but it’s an instructive one: We’re used to seeing 500MHz CPUs give way to 1GHz CPUs give way to 2GHz CPUs, and so on. Today we’re in the 3GHz range on mainstream computers.

=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
Starting today, the performance lunch isn’t free any more. Sure, there will continue to be generally applicable performance gains that everyone can pick up, thanks mainly to cache size improvements. But if you want your application to benefit from the continued exponential throughput advances in new processors, it will need to be a well-written concurrent (usually multithreaded) application. 

=== !

[quote,Herb Sutter,The Free Lunch Is Over]
And that’s easier said than done, because not all problems are inherently parallelizable and because concurrent programming is hard.
I can hear the howls of protest: “Concurrency? That’s not news! People are already writing concurrent applications.” That’s true. Of a small fraction of developers.

== Concurrency is the next major revolution in how we write software

=== 20 years later

the problem is so hard that we are trying to not be bothered by it :)

and let virtual machines, frameworks and compilers do this job for us

* Threads and Locks 
* Functional Programming
* Software Transactional Memory

== reference & object capabilities model

=== what is capability

A capability is an unforgeable token that +
(a) designates an object and +
(b) gives the program the authority to perform a specific set of actions on that object.

===  capabilities explained

[source, c]
----
int fd = open("/etc/passwd", O_RDWR);
----

`fd` holds not only information about type, +
but also what actions you can perform on object, +

object capabilities are like file permissions, but for objects
they tell you what you can do with object

=== capabilities

every object holds a unforgeable tag, which is its capability

no pointer arithmetics +
It means objects can be only reached when created or passed as method calls arguments

no global state +
They’re bad! Because you can get them without either constructing them or being passed them

[role="highlight_section_title"]
=== oh, man this is hard

image::baby-610x250.jpg[background,size=contain]

=== how it is done?

using type qualifiers ;) and crazy compiler mechanics

=== !

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	int i = 10;
	int j = 20;
	/* ptr is pointer to constant */
	const int *ptr = &i;

	printf("ptr: %d\n", *ptr);
	/* error: object pointed cannot be modified
	using the pointer ptr */
	*ptr = 100;

	ptr = &j;		 /* valid */
	printf("ptr: %d\n", *ptr);

	return 0;
}

=== capabilities for dummies 

think about capabilities as `const` or Java `final` +
on steroids, amphetamine or DMT

----

This won't compile

=== !

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
  In Pony, every use of a type has a reference capability. These capabilities apply to variables, rather than to the type as a whole. In other words, when you define a class Wombat, you don’t pick a reference capability for all instances of the class. Instead, Wombat variables each have their own reference capability.

=== !

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
  As an example, in some languages, you have to define a type that represents a mutable String and another type that represents an immutable String. For example, in Java, there is a String and a StringBuilder. In Pony, you can define a single class String and have some variables that are String ref (which are mutable) and other variables that are String val (which are immutable).

=== why it didn't work?

let's get back to basics of capabilities

[graphviz]
----
digraph{
  rankdir = LR
  Subject -> Invocation [label=Authority]
  Invocation -> Resource
}

[source,pony]

=== !

[graphviz]
----
digraph{
  rankdir = LR
  AnObject -> push [label="?"]
  push -> array
}
----

=== !

what is the authority in this case?

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
  *box* This is for references to data that is read-only to you. That data might be immutable and shared with other actors or there may be other variables using it in your actor that can change the data. Either way, the box variable can be used to safely read the data. This may sound a little pointless, but it allows you to write code that can work for both val and ref variables, as long as it doesn’t write to the object.

=== !

it will become more clear when we will discuss capabilities subtyping

but for now let's remember box is default capability of methods in classes

=== !

[graphviz]
----
digraph{
  rankdir = LR
  AnObject -> push [label="box"]
  push -> array
}
----

=== !

Let's have a look at Array class

[source,pony]
----
class Array[A] is Seq[A]
  fun ref push(value: A) =>
    """
    Add an element to the end of the array.
    """
    reserve(_size + 1)
    _ptr._update(_size, consume value)
    _size = _size + 1
----

=== !

This method expects ref capability

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
Reference, written ref. This is for references to mutable data structures that are not isolated, in other words, “normal” data. If you have a ref variable then you can read and write the data however you like and you can have multiple variables that can access the same data. But you can’t share it with other actors.

of course there must be third capability called _val_

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
Value, written val. This is for references to immutable data structures. If you have a val variable then you know that no-one can change the data. So you can read it and share it with other actors.

by default, all objects have _ref_ capability, 
unless it is changed in class declaration

[source,pony]

it doesn't mean all instances will have _val_ capability,+
only if we call default constructor

[source,pony]

class A val
  
  new immutable() =>

  new ref mutable() =>

=== but mom, why?

in Pony actors can only accept _sendable types_, +
aka types that are safe to share with others +
_val_,_iso_, _tag_ (yeap, new kid on the block)

=== !

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
Tag. This is for references used only for identification. You cannot read or write data using a tag variable. But you can store and compare tags to check object identity and share tag variables with other actors.

but how we can make _ref_ an _iso_ ?

=== Consume and Destructive Read

[quote,,Pony Tutorial]
An important part of Pony’s capabilities is being able to say “I’m done with this thing.” We’ll cover two means of handling this situation: consuming a variable and destructive reads.

== Introduction

Philosophers in a pony land


=== how to start

at the moment there is a package available +
but its pretty old +
real man do this +

`apt-get install build-essential llvm-3.6-dev && git clone https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc && cd ponyc && make install`

=== !

image::logo-showmethecode.png[background]

=== reference capability

how does Pony give us all this safety?

=== quick reminder

remember that Pony is capabilities-secure?

=== the compiler

image::AoU_Iron_Man_01.png[background]


=== !

where would be Java, Hibernate and Spring +
without `public static` ?


=== isolated, written iso

This is for references to isolated data structures. If you have an iso variable then you know that there are no other variables that can access that data. So you can change it however you like and give it to another actor.

=== !

graphviz::src/main/slides/iso-cap.dot[]

graphviz::src/main/slides/iso-cap-consume.dot[]

=== value, written val

This is for references to immutable data structures. If you have a val variable then you know that no-one can change the data. So you can read it and share it with other actors.

=== !

graphviz::src/main/slides/val-cap.dot[]


=== reference, written ref

This is for references to mutable data structures that are not isolated, in other words "normal" data. If you have a ref variable then you can read and write the data however you like and you can have multiple variables that can access the same data. But you can't share it with other actors.

=== !

graphviz::src/main/slides/ref-cap.dot[]

=== box

This is for references to data that is read-only to you.
That data might be immutable and shared with other actors or there may be other
variables using it in your actor that can change the data.
Either way the box variable can be used to safely read the data.

=== !

graphviz::src/main/slides/box-cap.dot[]

=== transition, written trn

This is used for data structures that you want to write to and give out
read-only (`box`) variables to.
You can also convert the `trn` variable to a val variable later if you wish,
which stops anyone from changing the data and allows it be shared with other actors.

=== !

graphviz::src/main/slides/trn-cap.dot[]

=== tag

This is for references used only for identification. You cannot read or write data using a tag variable. But you can store and compare tags to check object identity and share tag variables with other actors.

=== an example

[source,pony]
----
use "collections"

class AnObject
  let arr : Array[U8] = Array[U8]
  fun add(v : U8) =>
    arr.push(v)
----

This won't compile

=== receiver type is not a subtype of target type

classes are by default `ref`, but methods are `box`

== Destructive reads, recovery and consumption

image::masthead-cdsguided-weapon-systems-msc-810x344copyright.jpg[background]

=== sendable values

before we dive in, we need to do a step back

=== immutable is good

=== bullshit!

=== just think for a moment

the world is globally immutable +
but locally mutable +

=== WAT!?!

image::confused.jpg[background]

=== !

read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time[arrow of time], +
cyclic and linear processes, +
entropy and all this nerdy stuff +
or study thermodynamics

=== no worries I have just made this up

=== immutable is expensive

that's a fact

=== but mutable is hard

unless you can isolate access to such data

in Pony you can only pass `val` (immutable), +
`tag` (opaque) +
or `iso` (isolated) data +
to actor

=== working with isolated data

how does Pony ensure there is only one reference (alias) to an object?

you need to destroy the reference, either by consuming it or destructive read

=== example

[source, pony]
----
class Counter
  var _value : I32 = 0
  fun ref inc() =>
    _value = _value+1
  fun ref dec() =>
    _value = _value-1
  fun box counter() : I32 => _value

actor Incrementer
  be inc(c : Counter iso) => // pass sendable
    c.inc()  // capabiltiies sub-typing
    Decrementer.dec(consume c) //consume value

actor Decrementer
  be dec(c : Counter iso) => // pass sendable
    c.dec()  // capabiltiies sub-typing
    Incrementer.inc(consume c)

actor Main
  new create(env : Env) =>
    var c = Counter
    Incrementer.inc(consume c)
----

=== consume

when you consume reference, you cannot use it anymore in the code

[source, pony]
----
actor Incrementer
  be inc(counter : Counter iso) => // pass sendable
    counter.inc()  // capabiltiies sub-typing
    Decrementer.dec(consume counter) //consume value
    env.out.print(counter.counter()) // <1>
----
<1> this wont work, `counter` doesn't exist anymore

=== ephemeral type

remeber, everything is expression?

[source, pony]
----
anActor.doStuff(consume data)
----

What is the type of `consume`? +
it is `iso^`, so called ephemeral, in short +
"shit I don't know what it is, I just consumed it, so it is whatever you like it to be"

=== !

image::3515844-6818749515-a2f3d.jpg[background]

=== ephemeral type

it's a type for a value that currently has no name (it might have a name through some other alias, but not the one we just consumed or destructively read). +

a constructor always returns an ephemeral type, because it's a new object

=== destructive read

in Pony everything is an expression +
so what is return type of assignment ? +

[source, pony]
----
var counter' = (counter = None)
----

it is the old value, it is called destructive read

since you cannot consume fields +
(I hope it is obvious at this point) +
you can use destructive read to get isolated capability

=== recovering capabilities

[source, pony]
----
var arr =
recover val // <1>
  var array = Array[U8]
  array.push(1)
  array.push(2)
  array.push(3)
  array // <2>
end
----
<1> this is how you "lift" `ref` to `val`
<2> remember everything is an expression

=== recovering capabilities

let's you "lift" the reference capability of the result.
A mutable reference capability (`iso`, `trn`, or `ref`) can become any reference capability,
and an immutable reference capability (`val` or `box`) can become any immutable or
opaque reference capability.

=== capabilities sub-typing

do I have to always use `recover` ? +
actually not, because there is capabilities sub-typing +
if you need to pass `iso` and you have `ref`, it is ok +
if you need `box` and have `val` that's ok too +

Sub-typing is transitive

=== the things I missed

ambient authority +
ephemeral types +
alias types +
I just got a feel how it works, it is not enough to share with the crowd

== Chapter IV

Garbage collector and other internals


=== ORCA

Pony is garbage collected runtime, it uses it's own algorithm called ORCA, +
and yes, it is reference counting garbage collector, +
deferred, distributed, weighted, concurrent +
WHAT?

=== when garbage collection happens

in short garbage collection happens when actor has finished processing of the message,
and thanks to message passing it can defer reference counting +

but it still leaves cyclic references a problem

=== when actor is blocked

so, when actor is garbage collected? +
when there as no messages in mailbox (actor is blocked) +
and all other actors which hold reference to it are also blocked

=== mailboxes

in Pony mailboxes are Lamport's queues +
they use GCC extensions which adds atomic variables to ANSI C

----
<1> notice `be` in place of `fun` and no return type
